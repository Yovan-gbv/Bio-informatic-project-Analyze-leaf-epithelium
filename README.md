# Bio-informatic-project-Analyze-leaf-epithelium
In this project, we will analyze the shape of cells in leaf epithelia using image analysis techniques. We will develop a Python codebase to extract relevant features from images of leaf epithelia, and use these features to answer questions about the tissue's structure and organization.
